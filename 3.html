			<p>Thus in this world fate all with a bell's tolling ends,<br>
	Great ambitions, great projects of imagination,<br>
	Childhood's playtimes and friendship's heart-felt consolations,<br>
	The hearts' tender confessions! Should some dread bronze roar<br>
	From afar, all is shattered, confused – is no more!<br>
	The balks, upon which scattered quiet pear trees stand.</p>
