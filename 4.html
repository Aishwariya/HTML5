			<p>If you these with amazing great bravery subdue<br>
Then even more dire perils are waiting for you:<br>
There lie in wait, like wolf-pits, that dare you to pass,<br>
Little pools half grown over with mat of rank grass<br>
So very deep, that no man can fathom such pit,<br>
(And it is very likely, therein devils sit).<br>
Water in these shafts glistens, with bloody rust spotted,<br>
And steam from the depths rises, with smell of things rotted,<br>
Which makes the trees that grow there lose all leaf and bark;<br>
Bald and dwarfish, worm-riddled, unhealthy and stark,<br>
With mossy tangled elf-locks from crooked limbs hanging,<br>
And stumps hump-backed, and bristling with unlovely fungi,<br>
Squat like a witches' coven round a cauldron wheezing,<br>
Their hands warming, while in it a fresh corpse is seething.<br>
